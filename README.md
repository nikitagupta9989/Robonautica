### TASK 1 

`aruco_detection.py`:
	This file contains code for detection of aruco markers while teleoperating.
	It stores the pose of the bot wrt the marker(rvec[0][0] and tvec[0][0], since rvec and tvec are of the type [[[a,b,c]]]) at minimum distance
	It also stores the minimum distance, and the position of the bot wrt origin at this minimum distance into `file.pkl`
	
`send_external_goals.py`:
	This file contains code for autonomously travelling to the aruco markers in a given sequence (entered into the marker_array array)
	It takes the position and orientation vectors from `file.txt` generated by aruco_detection.py

`2dnav_task1.rviz`:
	Rviz config file for quickly loading map, pose, and bot footprint

`turtoisebot_2dnav`:
	This is a package created for 2d navigation.
	This contains all the necessary files for 2d navigation, including costmap params, map and map yaml
	
## TASK 2

Steps to run:
	1. Run the simulation in gazebo 
    2. Run `cv_lane_detect.py`

Working:
    The script takes the raw image from the camera and masks the yellow so that only the lanes remain
    Then it modifies the masked image so that we get a top down bird's eye view of the lanes
    Then the `scan` function governs the movement of the bot using `move_robot` and `turn` functions.

## TASK 3 

Steps to run:
    1. Run the simulation in gazebo
    2. Start the move_base server:
        `roslaunch turtoisebot_2dnav move_base.launch`
    3. Run task_3.py

#### NOTE:
    For this task, we made changes to the global costmap params so that it has `rolling_window:true` and `static_map` set to `false`

`task_3.py`:
    This is a simple script that sends a goal of moving forward 5 meters straight ahead to the bot.
    The obstacle detection is handled by the Nav Stack itself.
